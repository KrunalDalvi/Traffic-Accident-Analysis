# Traffic-Accident-Analysis
Analyzing traffic accident data is essential for improving road safety and understanding contributing factors. This project focuses on identifying patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day using a comprehensive dataset that includes details such as severity, location, weather conditions, and timestamps. By visualizing accident hotspots and examining contributing factors, we aim to provide valuable insights to enhance traffic safety measures and reduce accident occurrences.
